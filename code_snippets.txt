for SQL querying with datetime:
    # conn = None
    # conn = get_connection()
    # #this would return everything after the most recent log stream
    # sample_query = f"SELECT last_updated from design where last_updated >= :result"
    # result = conn.run(sample_query, result=result)
    # print(result)

    # conn.close()


can't add the rule about time until after the first data dump
